  <h2>Johnson Family Vineyard History</h2>

  <ul class="timeline1">
    <li class="date">1944</li>
    <li class="info">Cosmo Anthony Johnson owned and operated a small winery in Ashtabula, Ohio, serving the local area with wine and
      fresh pressed juice. As wine consumption in America declined, and beer came into favor, he closed the winery and went
      to work for the New York Central Railroad.</li></ul>

<ul class="timeline1">
    <li class="date">1957</li>
    <li class="info">He started a small railroad construction company.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="timeline1">
    <li class="date">1962</li>
    <li class="info">He asked his son and daughter-in-law, Larry & Ida, to join the company.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="timeline1">
    <li class="date">1971</li>
    <li class="info">Larry’s sons and nephews began working in the railroad industry.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="timeline1">
    <li class="date">1974</li>
    <li class="info">Cosmo directed his grandson Larry Jr. to jump the fence surrounding the Burkholder farm and pick some fresh grapes. This small event brought the dream of this winery to our family.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="timeline1">
    <li class="date">1991</li>
    <li class="info">Larry Jr. read in the paper that a grape farm was being auctioned. He recognized it as the same farmland where he had jumped the fence to grab a cluster of grapes with his grandfather. On the following weekend the family gathered at the auction and with one giant leap of faith bought the farm.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="timeline1">
    <li class="date">2002</li>
    <li class="info">Ever since then, the dream of owning a winery has become Larry Jr’s. and his wife Kim’s reality. This event tied the generations back together.<br><br>
    <p class="quote">“We dedicate, in our grandfather’s memory, Off the Vine. Just as important and influential in our families’ lives are our parents, Larry & Ida Laurello. They continue to own and operate Delta Railroad Construction, Inc. Both have been instrumental in bringing about the dream of the winery.”</p>
    They can be found periodically sipping wine on the weekends with family & friends.</li>

Kim & Larry, <br>
Guy & Georgia Visited the winery this December 2010 and was delighted with the customer service and friendliness of Susan. She is a positive addition to the Laurello staff. She was also assisted by Stefanie who was very warm and helpful when Susan needed to greet other incoming guests. Not only do we love the food and wine but the warm and welcoming of the entire staff. Keep up the good work.

Dear Kim & Larry,<br>
I cannot compliment you enough for a wonderful evening. I will say this to you. I have never enjoyed myself more at one of my own parties as I did the night of the wine tasting at our home. Kim, you far exceeded any expectations I had with your kindness and warmth and very capable hands. You took care of everything giving me the absolute JOY of seeing our friends enjoyment! Ken and I entertain in our home often, but I never felt so at ease or confident that everyone at the party was having the best time.
You and Larry offer a wonderful gift. Your pride and the passion you have for the wine you make is well deserved. The gift is, with your wine, you bring people together to put stress and worry aside and enjoy life through love and friendship and that is what life should be all about. It is obvious that you both derive pleasure through your giving. Ken and I, along with family and friends will enjoy your delicious wine and good times for years to come.
With sincere gratitude,
</li><li class="customers">Ken and Wendy S.

Dear Kim & Larry,<br>
Thank you for a great Valentine’s Day Dinner. It was a great night and a beautiful dinner. We only had four days with my cousin and your dinner was the hit of the weekend. I’m sure it was a lot of work and it was worth all your efforts, it was wonderful.
Thanks again.
